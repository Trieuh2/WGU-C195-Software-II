# Scheduler
Scheduler is an application used to create and manage appointments with the user, internal contacts within an organization, and external customers.

## Directions
1. Ensure that MySQL is running and is already connected to a database containing the client_schedule schema.
2. Run the application.
3. Login using valid credentials associated with a user that is added to the database.

## Additional Report in Part A3f
An additional report is generated within the AppointmentActivityController class which displays a scrolling table of when appointments were created, updated, or deleted.

The report is generated by parsing information from the "appointment_activity.txt" file.

Each time an Appointment is created, updated, or deleted to/from the database, a new line describing the action is appended to the mentioned txt file above containing the timestamp, appointment ID, appointment title, and the action performed.

## MySQL Connector Driver Version
"mysql-connector-java-8.0.26" was used for the development of this application.

## IDE, JDK, and JavaFX used for Development
    IntelliJ IDEA 2021.2.2 Ultimate Edition
